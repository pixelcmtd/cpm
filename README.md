# cpm
All the source for my ComputerCraft Package Manager.

# Installing
Just open up your Computer/Turtle and type in the following commands:
```
pastebin get 1xc1NGDQ cpm
cpm
```
Or if you are using a recent version of ComputerCraft, you can use:
```
pastebin run 1xc1NGDQ
```
If the pastebin command isn't available at all, you will have to type
in the [ÂµNetboot](unetboot.lua) manually.
